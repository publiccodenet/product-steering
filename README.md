# product-steering template instructions

## Introduction
This repository template is used to help members of a codebase to implement product management in the open.
A template repository allows you to easily create a new target product steering repository which includes the configuration, issue templates, files and other resources to get started. After having created the repository you can alter it to better suit your needs. 

Note: target refers to the repository you create based on this template repository

## How is it organized?
The repository includes the following:

- `product-steering template instructions` - The instruction you are reading now explaining how to use this template. You can remove this section from your target README
- `TEMPLATE README Product steering` - The README template for your target product-steering repository (see below) include suggestions for content
- An issue template for feature requests
- An [example kanban project board](https://github.com/publiccodenet/product-steering/projects/1) with welcome instruction card
- Issue labels
- Resources to learn more about product management

## How to read?
The template below uses the following readning conventions:

When you read 'CODEBASE NAME' you can replace this with the codebase name

When you see a link `[LINK](#insert-resource-here)` you can link to your own target repository assets such as CONTRUBTION.md, GOVERNANCE.md or other relevant documentation used in your codebase.

>**TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION**: Contains useful background information on how to use this section in the template. You can remove this sections from your target README

## How to use this template

When you have codebase where a community wants to organize product management in the open you can use this template to quickly create a repository to accomodate this.Once the repository has created you can tweak the newly created repository to fit your needs.

1. Make sure you have sufficient acces rights to the target repository where you want to create a new product-steering repository
2. Go to [https://github.com/publiccodenet/product-steering](https://github.com/publiccodenet/product-steering) and click on "Use This Template". Or open [https://github.com/publiccodenet/product-steering/generate](https://github.com/publiccodenet/product-steering/generate) in a new browser window
3. Select the correct "Owner" in the left dropdown, normally this would be the organization name of the target codebase where you want to create a new repository
4. Select a "Repository name". Make sure the name reflects
4. Go to your newly created target product-steering repository and alter the `TEMPLATE README Product steering`. And remove any template specific documentation and instructions  including this '`product-steering template instructions`
5. To re-use the kanban project board you need to manually recreate the Kaban board located at: [https://github.com/publiccodenet/product-steering/projects/1](https://github.com/publiccodenet/product-steering/projects/1) in the target repository as Github does not yet support public project templates.  **NOTE:** It is recommended to put your target project board on the organization level so you can also track issues across repositories under that organization.

>**TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION**: Use this section to link to or describe the product roadmap. 

## Codebase product management process
>**TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION**: Use this section to link or describe how the product management process works.  

## Product backlog
>**TEMPLATE INSTRUCTION**: Use this section to link or describe where the product backlog of the CODEBASE resides.

If you have a new idea for `CODEBASE NAME` or need a specific feature we love you to create a feature request.
You can do this as follows:

1. Check all the feature requests to make sure you feature is not already listed. If you see a related issue we welcome you to comment on exisiting issues
2. If there are no issues which cover your feature request you can create an issue [here](#insert-link-to-feature-request-issues) or go straigth to the form via: [LINK](#insert direct link to create github issue with feature request template)

Every X week(s) the product steering group will check incoming feature requests and may reach out to you for clarification or ask you to join the product steering group to discuss your feature request.Issues are prioritized and selected on our [Product Backlog](#insert link to location of product backlog)
