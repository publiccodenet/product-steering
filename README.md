## Create and submit a new feature request
If you have a new idea for Signalen or need a specific feature we love you to create a feature request.
You can do this as follows:

1. Check all the feature requests to make sure you feature is not already listed. If you see a related issue we welcome you to comment on exisiting issues
2. If there are no issues which cover your feature requst you can create an issue here: https://github.com/Signalen/product-steering/issues or go straigth to the form via: https://github.com/Signalen/product-steering/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE-REQUEST%5D)

Every 2 weeks the product steering group will check incoming feature requests and may reach out to you for clarification or ask you to join the product steering group to discuss your feature request. And they will be prioritized and selected on our Product Backlog here: https://github.com/orgs/Signalen/projects/2


## 
The Signalen community is hard at work to provide the nessacary documentation to make it easy for everyone to contribute to the Signalen project.
As of now we do not yet have our GOVERNANCE and CONTRUBUTE guidelines available.
